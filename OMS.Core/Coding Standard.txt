READ CAREFULLY
- Please read carefully this documentation regarding coding standard when you are create class, logics and other stuff that you will put in this project. PLEASE DO NOT APPLY WHAT EVER YOU 
THINK IS CORRECT. Please schedule a discussion with me if there is something you want to change in the structure and do not apply it yet. this structure is not 100% but we need to follow 
the existing structure to avoid confusion.

	- this is the folder where you need to put our utility classes. things that we need to use across the projects, utility methods like parsing strings, parsing integers, different kind of utility
methods/classes. do not add business logics and database logics here.
